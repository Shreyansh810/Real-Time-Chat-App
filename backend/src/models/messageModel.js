/* 
1. MongoDB:
   - Each User document has a unique `_id`.

2. Mongoose:
   - `ObjectId` in another model (e.g., Message) can store this `_id`.

3. `ref: "User"`:
   - Tells Mongoose which collection/model to fetch from when using `.populate()`.

4. `.populate("senderId")`:
   - Replaces the ObjectId with full user data in the result.
